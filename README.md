# Food-delivery-web

Based on the Youtube tutorial, I created a single-page Food Delivery Web. I used HTML, CSS and little bit of JS. The website should be fully responsive.

I will be happy for any feedback. In the future, I would like to transfer the entire website to the React and add new functionalities, such as dark / light switcher mode, modal-windows or simple order form.
